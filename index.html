<h1> <center> Gala Nicolas Kaufman </center> </h1>


<h2> Background </h2>

<p>
I received a PhD in physics from Cornell in 2014. From 2009 to 2014 I was a member of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) collaboration at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN (Switzerland), and worked primarily on new physics searches. 
</p>

<p>
After graduate school I made the transition to industry and have been employed as a data scientist at <a href="http://hiqlabs.com">hiQ Labs</a>, a people analytics SaaS company, since 2015. My work there has focused on predicting employee turnover.
